# Wiki Log

Record of every `ingest` run: what changed, why, and which `raw/` source
drove it, grouped under `## YYYY-MM-DD` date headings (ISO 8601) with the
**newest date group first**. Entries are prose bullets, e.g. `* **Update**:
…`, `* **Creation**: …`, `* **Deprecation**: …` — the leading bold word is a
convention, not a requirement.

**Add newest first, never edit or remove a prior entry.** "Newest first"
means a new entry (and, if today isn't already the top group, a new
`## YYYY-MM-DD` heading) is *prepended* above everything else — the
insertion point moves from the bottom to the top, but prepending never
touches a prior entry's text, so the append-only guarantee holds exactly as
before. If a past entry itself needs correcting, add a new entry that says
so; never edit or remove the old one in place. See `docs/wiki-schema.md` for
the full maintenance schema.

<!-- Example — two date groups, newest first, illustrating the ordering.
     Replace with your first real ingest entry, or delete once the log has
     one of its own.
