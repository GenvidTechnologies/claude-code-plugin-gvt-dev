description: Triages a project's issue backlog interactively — deduplicates, enriches, links dependencies, splits overstuffed issues, and stamps a 'triaged' label. Works for bugs, tickets, or any tracker item. Tracker-agnostic; project specifics come from docs/issue-triage.md and the bugTracker block in .genvid-agent.json. Use when triaging or grooming an issue backlog, or cleaning up duplicates and priorities.

# Triage Issues

Interactively triage a project's issue backlog (bugs, tickets, or any tracker
item): deduplicate, split, enrich, link dependencies, and stamp a `triaged`
label. The workflow is **tracker-agnostic** — every project specific comes from
`docs/issue-triage.md` (conventions + mutation recipes) and the `bugTracker`
block in `.genvid-agent.json` (access mechanics).

## How the work splits

- **Exploration → subagent.** All fetching and cross-issue analysis runs in the
  `genvid-dev:issue-triage-analyst` agent, off this thread, so this conversation
  stays focused on prioritization and adjustment.
- **Decisions → here.** This thread reviews the report, takes your adjustments,
  and performs every write. The analyst never writes.

## 0. Preconditions & scope

1. **Read `docs/issue-triage.md`.** If it is **absent**, offer to scaffold it from
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/triage-issues/issue-triage.template.md` — do not
   guess conventions. **If the user declines scaffolding, or a quick scan of the
   open backlog shows no bugs** (a tiny enhancement/chore backlog where the full
   taxonomy is overkill), offer a **light-touch groom** instead (→ §0a, which skips
   the rest of §0). Otherwise proceed with the full workflow only once the contract
   exists.
2. **Read the `bugTracker` block** from `.genvid-agent.json` (full workflow only —
   the §0a groom skips this). If it is **absent**,
   warn that fetching cannot proceed and offer to add one (show the example block
   at the bottom of this skill). Proceed only once it exists.
3. **Resolve scope:**
   - Default: `actionQuery` minus `triagedLabel` (open issues not yet triaged).
   - Override: an explicit query/label, or a list of issue IDs passed as args.
4. **Confirm mode:** interactive by default. `--non-interactive` (alias `--auto`)
   runs unattended; `--force` additionally permits destructive actions unattended.

### 0a. Light-touch groom (no-contract path)

A sanctioned path for small or bug-free backlogs that skips the full contract. It
needs **neither `docs/issue-triage.md` nor the `bugTracker` block** (skip §0 step 2)
and operates **directly via the tracker's native CLI** (e.g. `gh`), using only the
tracker's **existing label vocabulary** — no analyst dispatch, no
`docs/issue-triage.md` or `bugTracker` writes, and no `triagedLabel` stamp. It
**bypasses §1–§5 entirely**:

- **Scan** the open issues in scope with the tracker's native list command.
- **Propose**, per issue, label / priority / clarity / cross-reference fixes drawn
  **only from labels that already exist** — never invent a taxonomy.
- **Apply** with per-item approval, holding the same §4 safety bar: never
  batch-close or mass-create issues without per-item approval (or `--force`).
- **Summarize** what changed.

When the groom reveals a backlog large or bug-heavy enough to warrant the full
taxonomy, stop and offer to scaffold `docs/issue-triage.md` (back to §0 step 1)
rather than grooming on.

## 1. Dispatch exploration (Phase 1)

Dispatch the `genvid-dev:issue-triage-analyst` agent with: the resolved scope, the
`bugTracker` block verbatim, and the path `docs/issue-triage.md`. It returns one
structured triage report. **Do not fetch issue bodies yourself** — keeping them
off this thread is the point of the split. Mode flags (`--non-interactive`,
`--force`) govern only this thread's approval and write behavior; the analyst
always runs read-only regardless.

## 2. Phase 1 review — cross-cutting findings (interactive)

Present the **relational** findings as a set: duplicate clusters, overlaps,
dependencies, split candidates. For each, let the user accept / reject / adjust
(e.g. change the canonical, drop a cluster member, reject a split). Destructive
items — close-as-duplicate, create split issues — are **recorded but NOT applied
here**; they are carried into the per-issue walk, matched to each affected issue
by issue number.

In `--non-interactive`, accept the analyst's findings as-is, but still defer the
destructive items unless `--force` was passed.

## 3. Phase 2 — per-issue walk (interactive)

For each action-set issue, gather its work from two places in the analyst's
report: its **Per-issue enrichment** row, and any Phase 1 relational findings
whose membership includes this issue's number (duplicate-cluster membership, an
accepted dependency, an approved split). Present both together, then apply the
approved changes using the **Mutation recipes** in `docs/issue-triage.md`:

- type / priority / field updates, label add/remove, body language fixes;
- `needsInfoLabel` + a comment when a required field is missing (or let the
  triager supply the missing info inline, then skip the label);
- dependency links;
- duplicate handling per the project's **Duplicates** policy (link-only, or
  close-as-duplicate to the canonical — closing needs approval, see §4);
- split-issue / sub-issue creation per the **Splitting** policy;
- **last**, add `triagedLabel` — only after the issue's other approved changes
  succeed. This keeps the skill idempotent: an aborted run leaves the issue
  un-triaged, so re-running picks it up again.

Apply one issue fully before moving to the next. If a write fails, stop on that
issue, report the failure, and do **not** stamp `triagedLabel`.

## 4. Safety

| Action | Interactive (default) | `--non-interactive` |
|---|---|---|
| Field / label / priority / body / language | per-issue approval | auto-apply |
| `needs-info` label + comment | approve | auto-apply |
| Dependency links | approve | auto-apply |
| Close-as-duplicate / create split issues | approve per item | **deferred** unless `--force` |
| `triaged` label | after the issue's changes | after the issue's changes |

Never batch-close or mass-create issues without either per-item approval or an
explicit `--force`. These actions are hard to reverse on most trackers.

## 5. Closing summary

Report: issues triaged; fields / labels / priorities changed; duplicates linked or
closed; issues split or created; dependencies linked; and anything left
`needs-info` or deferred for a follow-up run.

## Example `bugTracker` block

Add this to `.genvid-agent.json` (GitHub / `gh` example — adjust queries, labels,
and the CLI for your tracker):

```json
"bugTracker": {
  "kind": "github",
  "actionQuery": "gh issue list --state open -L 200 --json number,title,labels,body,assignees",
  "comparisonQuery": "gh issue list --state all -L 500 --json number,title,labels,state",
  "readOne": "gh issue view {id} --json number,title,body,labels,comments",
  "triagedLabel": "triaged",
  "needsInfoLabel": "needs-info"
}
```
